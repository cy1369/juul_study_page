### INFORMED CONSENT FORM FOR PARTICIPANTS

#### ABOUT THE STUDY

You are being invited to take part in a research study. Your participation is voluntary which means you can choose whether or not you want to take part in this study. People who agree to take part in research studies are called "participants", "subjects" or "research subjects". These words are used throughout this consent form. Before you can make your decision, you will need to know what the study is about, the possible risks and benefits of being in this study, and what you will have to do in this study. You may also decide to discuss this study and this form with your family, friends, or doctor. If you have any questions about the study or about this form, please ask us. If you decide to take part in this study, you must sign this form. We will give you a copy of this form signed by you for you to keep.

#### WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY?

The purpose of this study is to assess smokers' opinions about one or more "electronic nicotine delivery systems" (ENDS), also sometimes called electronic cigarettes, E-cigs, or vaporizers. What we learn from this study will help us understand the degree that ENDS are satisfying and/or pleasurable for smokers. As you are being asked to volunteer in a research study, this consent/authorization form includes information that is meant to help you decide whether or not you would like to take part.

#### HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE STUDY? HOW MANY OTHER PEOPLE WILL BE IN THE STUDY?

The study lasts about 8-weeks, but the effort required is relatively low. We estimate that the following number of subjects will enroll in this study: 160

#### WHAT WILL I BE ASKED TO DO IN THE STUDY?

This is NOT a study about quitting or smoking cessation, so during the study you are encouraged to use cigarettes as much or as little as you want on any given day. In addition to any cigarette smoking you choose to do, you will be asked to try out a cutting-edge vaporizer or electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS), and you will be provided with refills as needed in a flavor or your choosing. To enroll in the study you must visit our designated a NYU mHealth study site near Washington Square in Greenwich Village so that we can verify your smoking status and photo ID, provide you with an ENDS device and supplies, show you how to use the ENDS device if needed and answer any other questions. You are required to bring a pack of your preferred brand of cigarettes to this initial visit so that we can document you cigarette preferences in a precise way.

If you participate in this study you will be asked to track your cigarette and ENDS smoking over a total of 10 weeks. You would do this by responding to text messages that we would send you about 4 times per day. These very brief messages would ask about smoking and ENDS use, and would not require more than a minute or two of your time

The study requires that you only use the ENDS device provided to you by the study team. All participants will receive their ENDS device AFTER they have completed a 2-week observation period, and some may not receive a device. If you are asked to switch devices a new device will be delivered to you via a delivery service that will check for the same photo ID presented on your initial enrollment in the study. Participants are required to save all used ENDS liquid cartridges and exchange them for new ones when needed. If / when you run out of ENDS liquid we will resupply you using a delivery service if that is more convenient than stopping by our office. If you successfully complete the study you will be gifted any ENDS device(s) you tested during the study (each retails for about $35), in addition to the monetary incentives described in the "Incentives" section below.

#### RISKS AND BENEFITS

----------------------

+ The main risks if you participate in the study are the risks of loss of privacy and confidentiality. However, the risk of your information being seen is extremely low because of strong computer-based security systems.

+ Subjects may experience side effects from using an electronic cigarette including mouth and throat irritation, mouth and throat dryness and dry cough.

+ Participants may benefit from harm reduction due to switching from combustible cigarettes to e-cigarettes, but this is a new area of research for which the results of the proposed study are applicable.

###WHAT IF NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE?

During the course of this study we may find more information that could be important to you. This includes information that might cause you to change your mind about being in the study. We will notify you as soon as possible if such information becomes available.

#### INCENTIVES

You will receive a $50 Amazon gift card for completing the survey (approximately 8 weeks). You are also able to keep any e-cigarette devices and pods used during the study.

#### CONFIDENTIALITY

Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained by numerically by coding all data and disguising identifying information.

#### VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND WITHDRAWAL AND SHARING OF INFORMATION

---------------------------------------------------------------------

+ Participation in this study is voluntary. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without penalty. You do this by contacting the study researchers at (212) 992-6144.

+ When you withdraw from the study, no information identifying you will be gathered after that date. Information that has already been gathered may still be used.

+ When the results of this study are made public, you will not be identified personally.

+ The information collected from you will only be used by the researchers and research staff at NYU mHealth. It could also be shared with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), but any data to be shared would be de-identified, which means that it would not include any information that could potentially identify you.

+ After the research is over you may review or copy your information.

+ If there is anything about the study or your participation that is unclear or that you do not understand, or if you have questions or wish to report a research-related problem, you may contact:
